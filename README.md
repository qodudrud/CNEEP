Pytorch implementation of the convolutional neural estimator for entropy production (CNEEP).


## Introduction

This repository is for the code related to the paper "Attaining entropy production and dissipation maps from Brownian movies via neural networks".

## Abstract

 Quantifying entropy production (EP) is essential to understand stochastic systems at mesoscopic scales, such as living organisms or biological assemblies. However, without tracking the relevant variables, it is challenging to figure out where and to what extent EP occurs from recorded time-series image data from experiments. Here, applying a convolutional neural network (CNN), a powerful tool for image processing, we develop an estimation method for EP through an unsupervised learning algorithm that calculates only from movies. Together with an attention map of the CNNâ€™s last layer, our method can not only quantify stochastic EP but also produce the spatiotemporal pattern of the EP (dissipation map). We show that our method accurately measures the EP and creates a dissipation map in two nonequilibrium systems, the bead-spring model and a network of elastic filaments. We further confirm high performance even with noisy, low spatial resolution data, and partially observed situations. Our method will provide a practical way to obtain dissipation maps and ultimately contribute to uncovering the nonequilibrium nature of complex systems.

## Installation

### Data

Because Github has a strict limit of file size, we share the data we used for the bead-spring model with $N=2$ through the link https://www.dropbox.com/s/ym0aipl8hf5zip1/data.zip?dl=0.

Please unzip this zip file and put an unzipped folder, named 'data', into the github folder containing the 'toy' and 'notebooks' folder.

### Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qodudrud/CNEEP
cd CNEEP
conda create -y --name cneep python=3.6
pip install -r requirement.txt
python -m ipykernel install --name cneep
```

## Jupyter notebook

See the following notebook for a quick run of CNEEP for the bead-spring model with $N=2$.
